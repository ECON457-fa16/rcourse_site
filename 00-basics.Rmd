```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(results="markup")
# knitr::knit_hooks$set(document = function(x){ 
#   gsub("```\n*```r*\n*", "", x) 
# }) # This allows output in same block as input
```

* Draw concept map of where we are headed towards best scientific practices, and reproducibility.
* Its really important that you know what you did. More journals/grants/etc. are also making it important for them to know what you did.
* A lot of scientific code is *not* reproducible.
* If you keep a lab notebook, why are we not as careful with our code? 
* We edit each others manuscripts, but we don't edit each other's code. 
* If you write your code with "future you" in mind, you will save yourself and others a lot of time.

R is a versatile, open source programming language that was specifically designed for data analysis. As such R is extremely useful both for statistics and data science. Inspired by the programming language S.  

* Open source software under GPL.  
* Superior (if not just comparable) to commercial alternatives. R has over 5,000 user contributed packages at this time. It's widely used both in academia and industry.  
* Available on all platforms.  
* Not just for statistics, but also general purpose programming.  
* Is (sort of) object oriented and functional.  
* Large and growing community of peers.

## Introduction to R and RStudio

Let's start by learning about our tool.

_Point out the different windows in RStudio._

* Console, Scripts, Environments, Plots
* Avoid using shortcuts. 
* Code and workflow is more reproducible if we can document everything that we do.
* Our end goal is not just to "do stuff" but to do it in a way that anyone can 
  easily and exactly replicate our workflow and results.

You can get output from R simply by typing in math
	
```{r}
3 + 5
12 / 7
```

or by typing words

```{r}
"Hello World"
```

### Calculations

R can be used just like a calculator (as shown before).

```{r}
3 + 5
12 / 7
6 * 5
3 ^ 4
```

1.  What is nine raised to the power of three?
2.  Nine raised to the power of 0.5?
3.  What is the result of `3 * 4 + 5`? And `5 + 3 * 4`? What does this indicate?

#### R Respects standard order of operations in math:

```{r}
3 * 4 + 5
3 * (4 + 5)
```

### Assignment

R is an _object-oriented_ programming language.  Everything we do in R, we 
do with _objects_. We can save our results to an _object_, if we give it a name.

`<-` is the assignment operator.  The *result* of the operation on the right hand 
side of `<-` is *assigned* to an object with the name specified on the left 
hand side of `<-`.  Put spaces around `<-` (and all other operators).

```{r}
hrs_per_day <- 24
days_per_week <- 7
hrs_per_week <- hrs_per_day * days_per_week
hrs_per_week
```

1.  Set `x` to be 7. What is the value of `x ^ x`? Save the value in a an object
    called `i`.
2.  If you asign the value 20 to the object `x` does the value of `i` change? 
    What does this tell you about how **R** assigns values to objects?

#### A note about naming things:
Name things so that you can understand them later, try to balance brevity with 
clarity. `x` is easy to type, but may not mean much.

* Only begin names with letters.
* Separate words with a dot (`my.var`) or an underscore (`my_var`), or use 
`camelCase`.
* Try to be consistent.
* Avoid giving things names that already exist (like `mean`, `sum`, `log`)

### Functions

Most of R's power and flexibility comes from _functions_. 

A function is a saved object that takes inputs to perform a task. 
Functions take in information and return outputs.
A function takes zero, one, or many _arguments_ (also called _parameters_), 
depending on the function, and _returns_ a value. To call a function, 
type its name followed by brackets `()`. Arguments go inside the brackets 
and are separated by commas.

`name_of_function(arg1,arg2,arg3)`

```{r}
log(10)
sqrt(4)
max(4,8,2,6,9)
date() # Not all functions require arguments
```

#### Specifying arguments
Arguments can be specified using _positional_ and/or _named_ matching.  Some 
arguments have default values.

```{r}
# Positional matching: 10 is the first (and only) argument, and base is not 
# specified, so the default (e; i.e., natural logarithm) is used
log(5)

# If you want to do base 10 log:
log(5, 10)          # OR
log(x=5, base=10)   # OR even
log(base=10, x=5)   # But this is bad form, can cause rampant confusion because:
log(10,5)
```

#### Help

All functions come with a help screen. To get help on a function, type `?` 
followed by the function name.

```{r eval=FALSE}
?log
```

If you don't know the name of a function, you can find functions associated with
a topic by typing `??topic_name` (one word) or `??"topic phrase"` (multiple words).
Sometimes Google is just as (or more) effective.

It is important that you learn to read the help screens since they provide 
important information on what the function does, how it works, and usually 
sample examples at the very bottom.

1.  Which function calculates cumulative sums? And what arguments does it take?
2.  What arguments does the function `sqrt` take?

#### Some other useful functions for navigating

Get / set your working directory:
```{r eval=FALSE}
getwd()
setwd("H:/")
```

Get information about your current R Session. This is often helpful when trying
to figure out what went wrong, and when asking for help:

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

### Workspace
When a value is assigned to an object, the object can be used in subsequent 
calculations because it is stored in your _workspace_. The workspace is an area 
of memory associated with the current session

List objects in your workspace with `ls()` function.

```{r}
x <- 5
ls()
```

Remove objects from your workspace with the `rm()` function.

```{r}
rm(x)
```

Remove all objects from your workspace.

```{r}
ls()
rm(list = ls())
```

_Notice that we have **nested** one function inside of another._ Calling `ls()` 
generates a list of objects to remove.  This listis then passed to the `list`
argument of `rm()`, so all the items in that list are removed.

## Data types and structures

### Understanding basic data types in R

To make the best of the R language, you'll need a strong understanding of the 
basic data types and data structures and how to operate on those.

Very Important to understand because these are the objects you will manipulate 
on a day-to-day basis in R. Dealing with object conversions is one of the most 
common sources of frustration for beginners.

Everything in R is an object.

R has 6 (although we will not discuss the raw class for this workshop) data 
types.

* **character**: `"a"`, `"swc"`
* **numeric**: `2`, `15.5`
* **integer**: `2L` (the `L` tells R to store this as an integer)
* **logical**: `TRUE`, `FALSE`
* **complex**: `1+4i` (complex numbers with real and imaginary parts)

`class()` - what is it?

```{r}
# Example
x <- "Hello World"
class(x)

y <- 10
class(y)

z <- 5L
class(z)

q <- TRUE
class(q)
```

Logicals (`TRUE, FALSE`) merit a bit more exploration, derived with 
`>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=`

```{r}
5 > 3
3 >= 3

a <- 9
b <- 10
a == b # This is called a "logical equals"
a != b
```

_Note: You can encode logicals with `T` and `F` **but don't do it!**_ 
Use `TRUE` and `FALSE`:
```{r results='markup'}
T
T <- FALSE
T
# Chaos ensues
```

### Understanding basic data structures in R

R has many __data structures__. The main ones are:

* vector
* list
* matrix
* data frame
* factors

### Vectors

A vector is the most common and basic data structure in `R` and is pretty much 
the workhorse of R. It is a one-dimensional object with a series of values, all
of the same type.

A vector is a collection of elements that are most commonly `character`, 
`logical`, `integer` or `numeric`.

You can create an empty vector of various types by using their corresponding
functions, such as `character()`, `numeric()`, etc.

```{r}
character(5) ## empty character vector of length 5
numeric(5)
logical(5)
```

Usually, empty vectors aren't that useful. Use the function `c()` to manually 
construct vectors:

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
x
length(x)
```

`x` is a numeric vector. These are the most common kind. They are numeric 
objects and are treated as double precision real (decimal) numbers. 

To explicitly create integers, add an `L` to each (or *coerce* to the integer 
type using `as.integer()`).

```{r}
x1 <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)
```

You can also have logical vectors. 

```{r}
y <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
```

Finally you can have character vectors:

```{r}
first.names <- c("Sarah", "Tracy", "John")
```

**Examine your vector**  

```{r}
length(first.names)
class(first.names)
str(first.names)
```

1.  Do you see a property that's common to all these vectors above?

**Add elements to a vector**

```{r}
c(first.names, "Annette")
```

Note that the above doesn't actually change the `first.names` vector itself. Rather, 
it prints out a new (unassigned) vector made up of `first.names` with "Annette" added
to the end. If you want to actually update the `first.names` vector, you need to 
reassign it:

```{r}
first.names <- c(first.names, "Annette")
first.names
```

You can also create vectors as a sequence of numbers using `:` or `seq()`

```{r}
series <- 1:10
seq(10)
seq(1, 10, by = 0.1)
```

`NaN` means Not a Number. It's an undefined value.

```{r}
0/0
```

#### What happens when you mix types?

R will create a resulting vector that is the least common denominator; this is
called _coersion_. The coercion will move towards the one that's easiest to 
_coerce_ to:

`logical < integer < double < complex < character`

Guess what the following do without running them first

```{r}
xx <- c(1.7, "a") 
xx <- c(TRUE, 2) 
xx <- c("a", TRUE) 
```

This is called implicit coercion. You can also coerce vectors explicitly using 
the `as.<class_name>`. Example

```{r}
as.numeric("1")
as.character(1:2)
```

1. What happens when you try to coerce the following vector to numeric?

```{r}
x <- c("txt", "one", "1", "1.9")
y <- as.numeric(x)
```

1. Calculate the mean of `y`.  What happens?

#### __Indexing__

Each element in a vector has a numbered postiion and these numbers can be 
specified to subset the vector using `vector_name[index(es)]`.

```{r}
first.names[1]
```

Note that this doesn't actually change `first.names`, it just extracts and prints to the 
screen the elements you told it to (in this case the first name).

You can also put a vector inside the square brackets with the positions you want 
to extract:

```{r}
first.names[c(1,2,4)]
p <- c(1:3)
first.names[p]
```

You can use negative numbers to exclude elements:

```{r}
first.names[-3] # omit the third element
```

1.  Remove Tracy and John from the `first.names` vector.  How did you do this?

```{r}
first.names[-c(2,3)]
first.names[-2:-3]
first.names[c(1,4)]
first.names[!first.names %in% c("Tracy", "John")]
```

### Matrix

Matrices are a special vector in R. They are not a separate type of object but 
simply a vector with dimensions added on to it. Matrices have rows and columns.

```{r}
m <- matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
m
dim(m)
```

Matrices are filled column-wise.

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
```

Other ways to construct a matrix

```{r}
m      <- 1:10
dim(m) <- c(2, 5)
```

This takes a vector and transform into a matrix with 2 rows and 5 columns.

Another way is to bind columns or rows using `cbind()` and `rbind()`.

```{r}
x <- 1:3
y <- 10:12
cbind(x, y)
rbind(x, y)
```

### Lists

In R lists are a lot like vectors. Unlike vectors however, the contents of a 
list are not restricted to a single data type and can encompass any mixture of 
data types (even other lists!). This makes them fundamentally different from 
vectors.

Create lists using `list()` or coerce other objects using `as.list()`

```{r}
x <- list(1, "a", TRUE, 1+4i)
x

x <- 1:10
x <- as.list(x)
length(x)
```


Lists, like vectors, can be _indexed_, though slightly differently.  Use double 
square brackets `list[[index]]` to get the contents of a list element. Using 
single square will still return a list.

1. What is the class of `x[1]`?
2. How about `x[[1]]`?

```{r}
Andy <- list(name = "Andy", fav_nums = 1:10, fav_data = head(iris))
Andy
```

1. What is the length of this object? What about its structure?

Lists can be extremely useful inside functions. You can “staple” together lots 
of different kinds of results into a single object that a function can return.

A list does not print to the console like a vector. Instead, each element of 
the list starts on a new line.

* A data frame is a special type of list where every element of the list is a 
vector of the same length.

### Factors

Factors are special vectors that represent categorical data. Factors can be 
ordered or unordered and are important for modelling functions such as `lm()` 
and `glm()` and also in `plot()` methods.  _Almost any other time they're a 
huge pain._

Once created factors can only contain a pre-defined set values, known as *levels*.

Factors are stored as integers that have labels associated the unique integers. 
While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are actually 
integers under the hood, and you need to be careful when treating them like 
strings. Some string methods will coerce factors to strings, while others will 
throw an error.

Sometimes factors can be left unordered. Example: male, female.

Other times you might want factors to be ordered (or ranked). Example: low, 
medium, high.

Underlying it's represented by numbers 1, 2, 3.

They are better than using simple integer labels because factors are what are 
called self describing. male and female is more descriptive than 1s and 2s. 
Helpful when there is no additional metadata.

Which is male? 1 or 2? You wouldn't be able to tell with just integer data. 
Factors have this information built in.

Factors can be created with `factor()`. Input is often a character vector.

```{r}
x <- factor(c("yes", "no", "no", "yes", "yes"))
x
str(x)
```

`table(x)` will return a frequency table counting the number of elements in each 
level.

If you need to convert a factor to a character vector, simply use

```{r}
as.character(x)
```

To convert a factor to a numeric vector, go via a character. Compare:

```{r}
f <- factor(c(1,5,10,2))
as.numeric(f) ## wrong!
as.numeric(as.character(f))
```

In modeling functions, it is important to know what the baseline level is. This 
is the first factor but by default the ordering is determined by alphanumerical 
order of elements. You can change this by speciying the `levels` (another 
option is to use the function `relevel()`).

```{r}
x <- factor(c("yes", "no", "yes"), levels = c("yes", "no"))
x
```

### Data frames

A data frame is a very important data type in R. It's pretty much the de facto 
data structure for most tabular data and what we use for statistics.

Some additional information on data frames:

* Usually created by `read.csv()` and `read.table()`.
* Can also create with `data.frame()` function.
* Find the number of rows and columns with `nrow(dat)` and `ncol(dat)`, 
  respectively.
* Rownames are usually 1, 2, ..., n.

#### Creating data frames

```{r}
dat <- data.frame(id = letters[1:10], x = 1:10, y = 11:20)
dat
```

#### Useful functions

* `head()` - show first 6 rows
* `tail()` - show last 6 rows
* `dim()` - returns the dimensions
* `nrow()` - number of rows
* `ncol()` - number of columns
* `str()` - structure of each column
* `names()` - shows the `names` attribute for a data frame, which gives the 
  column names.

### Summary of Data Structures

| Dimensions | Homogenous | Heterogeneous |

### Get new functions: Packages

To install any package use `install.packages()`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")  ## install the ggplot2 package
```

You can't ever learn all of R, but you can learn how to build a program and how 
to find help to do the things that you want to do.

Let's get hands-on.
