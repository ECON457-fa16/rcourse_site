#### Credits
Most of the material here was borrowed and adapted from 
[Software Carpentry](http://www.softwarecarpentry.org)'s
[novice R Bootcamp material](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/tree/master/novice/r)

and 

[Poisson Consulting](http://www.poissonconsulting.ca/)'s 
[R course notes](http://www.poissonconsulting.ca/courses/2012/06/05/an-introduction-to-r-course-12.html).

Much of the `dplyr` material came from the dplyr [package vignette](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html)
