#### Credits
Most of the material here was borrowed and adapted from 
[Software Carpentry](http://www.softwarecarpentry.org)'s
[novice R Bootcamp material](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/tree/master/novice/r), 
which they make available for reuse under the Creative Commons Attribution [(CC_BY)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license. 
These are amazing people, doing amazing things to help the scientific world be 
more productive with their code and data. Check them out, and if you get the chance 
to attend a bootcamp, do it.

The [course notes](http://www.poissonconsulting.ca/courses/2012/06/05/an-introduction-to-r-course-12.html) from [Poisson Consulting](http://www.poissonconsulting.ca/)'s 
2012 R Course were also very helpful in putting this material together.

Much of the `dplyr` material came from the dplyr [package vignette](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html).

When we went off-roading to play with the reshape2 package, we used material from 
[this website](http://seananderson.ca/2013/10/19/reshape.html).
